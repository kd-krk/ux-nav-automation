# UX nav automation with AI

Enhancing User Experience Navigation through AI Integration

## Summary

In this final project for the Building AI course, we delve into the realm of automating navigation optimization using web traffic data. The concept revolves around leveraging AI to analyze data from platforms like Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, heatmaps, and other web traffic analysis tools to enhance user experience, particularly focusing on navigation. The AI will experiment with different menu item placements to identify the most effective configuration.

## Background

Web architecture often poses challenges in managing and optimizing sites for optimal user experience. Traditional methods like A/B testing, surveys, and manual analysis may fall short in delivering the best user experience efficiently. This project targets a common issue faced by many companies - managing website architecture to ensure users understand the site's purpose and easily navigate to relevant sections. Have you ever visited a website where you felt lost and unsure where to click? This scenario is all too common.
Improving internal linking, anchor texts, and site structure can significantly impact conversions and enhance brand credibility. Collaborating with AI for data analysis presents an opportunity to achieve these goals effectively.


## How is it used?

This solution is applicable to websites with substantial traffic data (a few hundred daily visitors would suffice) and proper tracking mechanisms in place. Regardless of user demographics or acquisition channels, every user leaves a digital footprint that can be analyzed. By scrutinizing user behaviors and employing statistical analysis and machine learning, the AI can predict the most optimal navigation structure.


## Data sources and AI methods

Data for analysis must be sourced from tracking tools integrated into the website, with Google Analytics being a prevalent choice. Defining the "optimal" site architecture should be based on conversions tailored to stakeholder preferences.

### AI methods
TBD


## Challenges

This solution may not be suitable for websites with minimal traffic or a limited number of web pages.


## What next?

The project entails defining AI methods for data analysis, selecting appropriate tools, and validating their efficacy. Collaboration with UX designers and AI engineers is crucial for seamless implementation and follow-up.

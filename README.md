# UX nav automation with AI

Final project for the Building AI course and an idea to explore further.

## Summary

Automate a nav optimization with the web's traffic data. The idea is to have the AI working on the data from Google Analytics / Adobe Analytics or other web traffic analysis tools, heatmaps etc. and provide the best experience for the user, starting with the nav. The AI should then test different placement of menu items and find the optimum version of it.

## Background

Web architecture is often a big pain point when it comes to managing the site and optimizing it for the best user experience. A/B testings, surveys and thoughtful analysis are often not enough for building the best experience in a reasonable time frame. The idea is focused on a very common problem that many companies struggle with - managing the site architecure, so the user knows what the website is about and how to get to the directories in interest. Do you recall any website that you had no idea what to click and you felt completely lost? I can see them almost every day.

Better internal linkins, anchor texts and clear structure might be a key for better conversions and brand trustability. That can be achieved with cooperation with AI and its data analysis capabilities.


## How is it used?

The solution might be used on every website that has a decent traffic data (it is hard to guess the number, but a few houndreds visit daily could do the job) and tracking set up.
Regardless of a user type and generation channel, every user leaves a trace, that can be analyzed. Getting to analyze all user behaviors and predicting the most optimal nav structure based on regression analysis and machiine learning would be the job for the AI.on around the domainDescribe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-ux-getting-started/
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
